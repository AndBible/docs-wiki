## Experimental MyBible module support

Starting from `4.0.639` there is an experimental module support for MyBible module format, more specifically for Bible and Commentary modules.

1. Connect your device to computer with USB cable. 
2. Create a new folder `Android/data/net.bible.android.activity/files/mybible` 
3. Copy MyBible module files there. If you have MyBible installed, you can find its module files in `Android/data/ua.mybible/files/MyBible` (look for `*.SQLite3` files).
4. Restart And Bible and you will find the modules now installed.

Please note:
- Not yet working for MyBible modules: uninstalling modules, searching, backupping.

### Please note that this is unsupported and experimental feature. It might or might not work. Use at your own risk!
