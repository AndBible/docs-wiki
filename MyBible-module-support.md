## Experimental MyBible module support

Starting from 4.0.639 there is an experimental module support for MyBible module format, more specifically for Bible and Commentary modules.

To read MyBible modules, create a new folder `Android/data/net.bible.android.activity/files/mybible` and copy MyBible module files there. 

If you have MyBible installed, you can find its module files in `Android/data/ua.mybible/files/MyBible` (look for `*.SQLite3` files).

### Please note that this is unsupported and experimental feature. It might or might not work. Use at your own risk!
