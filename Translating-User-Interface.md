# User Interface Translation #

We are using a web based tool named [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to manage and simplify user interface translation. You can go to our [Transifex project page](https://www.transifex.com/mjdenham/andbible/), and click there _Help Translate "And Bible"_ to get started. You need free Transifex account do the translation.

Please also send us email so that we recognize you in the project and get your email address: help.andbible@gmail.com. Transifex does have "private messages" inside the platform, but I feel that sometimes email is more reliable to reach people.

To be able to translate And Bible successfully you need:
 - to have experience on And Bible and know more or less how it works and what it is 
 - to know English well enough
 - to have proficient skills in your own language (written form)
 - As And Bible is an ongoing project which evolves all the time, you should also have some commitment to keep on updating translations of And Bible in the future version updates
 
## Priorities in translation

There are 4 translatable resources in Transifex: `strings.xml`, 
`bibleview.yaml`, `BibleNames`, `Play Store texts`.

Translation priorities are like this:

 - `strings.xml` contains all Android side user interface texts. Please translate short items first. All of this is important to be translated, but if translation takes time several weeks, please prioritize your work such that easy and short strings will get ready sooner.
 - `bibleview.yaml` contains all javascript side user interface texts that are shown in features that are implemented directly on document views ("BibleView"). This is as important to be translated as strings.xml. 
 - `BibleNames` contains Bible book names and abbreviations. If these are missing in your language, please translate basic names and abbreviations of bible book names. Apocrypha is not really high priority (unless it is for you personally), you can leave it for later or even leave alltogether.
 - `Play Store texts` are texts for Google Play Store and F-Droid. Play Store main description will look like this in Play Store: [Play Store main description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvYphf-YrGFT6-lwKvXV9b-v2bIFTng1zYMKDPNSUII/edit).

## Tips to get translations right ##

To translate many of the user interface strings, you need to know the context in which the string is used in And Bible. We have added context instructions to some of the strings in Transifex. If some context still is not clear to you, you can

- See earlier context screenshots that I post when releasing new versions: [3.4](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/1028) [3.3](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/573), [3.2](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/472), [2.13](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/159).
- raise an issue within Transifex 

Sometimes existing strings get changed. In that case, you can utilize translation history to get translation done more easily.
