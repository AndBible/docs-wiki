# Do you need help? 

You can ask questions that other users might be able to answer:
 - via **And Bible users** group in [Telegram](https://t.me/andbible) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#andbible:matrix.org) (these are bridged together (connected), so you can choose which platform you like best)
 - Mailing list [at Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/and-bible).

You can ask questions directly from development team
 - via email: help.andbible@gmail.com.
 - via [Github support issues](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/new/choose)

Please report bugs primarily via `Main menu > report bug.` That way we can get more information that helps us
fix bugs. You can also report bugs [directly via github](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/new/choose).

Feel free to also [suggest new features](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues/new/choose).

Please refrain from asking questions via Play Store. Use above support channels instead. Thank you!
