And Bible is an open-source community project. In practice, this means that anyone with suitable skills can, and is encouraged to, contribute to the project by: 

- help other users who have questions by joining our [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/g/and-bible).
- promote our Bible Study App whenever you can, especially by giving us a good review on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.bible.android.activity).
- advertising: making videos, reviews, blogs...
- testing not-yet-released features by joining the Beta program at the Google Play Store or by [installing the very latest builds](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/releases). You can then [send us your feedback](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues).
- helping with documentation and tutorials
- helping with marketing materials: graphics, videos etc. 
- helping with extending the module library by making new modules or getting licenses for existing ones.
- [translating user interface to a language that you know / helping maintaining/improving translations](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/wiki/Translating-User-Interface),
- And last, help us [develop new features](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature%22) especially if you master Kotlin / Java / Javascript / Vue.js (of course you can learn these by doing if you are familiar with programming of any sort),
