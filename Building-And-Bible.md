And Bible build has been migrated to Android Studio.

Download and Install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk).

Open a Terminal/command prompt.

Create a directory e.g. 'mydevdir' and change to that directory.

Run:
git clone -b development --depth 1 https://github.com/mjdenham/and-bible.git

In Android Studio select File/Open.  Then open the and-bible folder with a green compass icon under mydevdir/and-bible/and-bible.
