Pre-release versions of And Bible now normally go directly to beta rather than via alpha because beta registration is simpler.

## Beta Testing
Beta testing is open to all.  You can opt-in via the And Bible Play Store page [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.bible.android.activity).

## Beta APK files

If you don't want to use Google Play, you can download beta release APK's from [releases page](https://github.com/AndBible/and-bible/releases).
