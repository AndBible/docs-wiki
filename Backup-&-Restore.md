And Bible notes and bookmarks are stored only on the phone, aside from Google's app backup if your device settings are that way.

Here's how you can backup and restore your app data (that is, notes, bookmarks, reading plan status, workspaces):
1. Click menu icon on top left and scroll down to "Backup & Restore"
2. Click "Backup application database to..."
3. Click "Share" or "Phone Storage". With share you can save to Telegram, or send it to someone via Whatsapp or email, and then you have a copy there. Phone storage let's you select where you want to save the file in your storage.

4. To restore the backup file, get the file into the new phone, or wherever you want the backup to be restored to.
5. Install And Bible on new phone if needed, and this is optional, but things would probably work smoother if you would first download all the modules (Bible versions and commentaries) that you had before.
6. Click menu icon on top left and scroll down to "Backup & Restore"
7. Click "Restore application database from..." and select the backup file

This process should restore your notes, bookmarks, reading plan statuses, and workspaces.

In some cases Google automatically restores your app backup on new install, but it's usually a few days old. Google does nightly backups of the app if your device settings are set that way.
